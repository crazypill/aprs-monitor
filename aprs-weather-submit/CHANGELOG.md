## Changes since version 1.4
* Added the `--no-comment` option to suppress this app's user agent in the comment section of the packet.

## Version 1.4
<time datetime="2020-03-08T22:59:19-04:00">March 8, 2020</time>
* Fixed a bug where latitudes and longitudes were not being converted into <abbr title="Degrees, minutes, seconds">DMS</abbr> *exactly* as they should be, which had been leading to minor position inaccuracies.
* Made uncompressed positions the default again, because [APRS.fi](https://APRS.fi) does not support weather packets with compressed positions.  [This is a long-standing bug on their web site.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/aprsfi/compressed%7Csort:date/aprsfi/uzjdm026NZQ/FqES7V2iAwAJ)  The `-0` and `--uncompressed-positions` options are still accepted for backwards compatibility, but no longer do anything.
* Better documentation for the compression type byte.
* Changed the copyright date for the new year.

## Version 1.3.1
<time datetime="2019-09-14T11:46:52-04:00">September 14, 2019</time>
* Fixed a bug where uncompressed latitudes greater than 90Â° were truncated.  This was not the default behavior. My apologies to anyone in Asia, Australia, Oceania, and most of the Americas.

## Version 1.3
<time datetime="2019-07-31T01:54:29-04:00">July 31, 2019</time>
* Added the compile-time option `NO_APRSIS` to strip all Internet-related functionality, just in case you're <em>really</em> low on space.

## Version 1.2.1
<time datetime="2019-07-31T01:13:29-04:00">July 31, 2019</time>
* Added &lt;stdint.h&gt; to prevent compiler errors.  (Thank you to UR3QJW for reporting this.)
* Switched from ANSI C to the C99 standard, in order to keep using `snprintf()`.  Some compilers are stricter than mine and refuse to compile K&R C with it.  (Another thank you to UR3QJW.)
* Since we switched to C99, I added some tiny performance enhancements with `restrict` and `inline`.
* Fixed a pair of bugs where uncompressed packets would fail to encode the location correctly.
* Fixed a bug where wind speeds would not be reported properly in compressed packets, because math is hard.
* Added linker options to the Makefile to fix linking errors with GCC 7.
* Code cleanup.
*<strong>Known issue:</strong> when compiling with GCC 7 and newer, there will be many warnings about formatting.  These can be ignored.  Adding `-Wno-format-detection` to the Makefile will quiet it down.  This will be patched in a future release.

## Version 1.2
<time datetime="2019-04-16T03:10:07-04:00">April 16, 2019</time>
* Added preliminary support for compiling on Windows.
* Added the option of using APRS uncompressed positions at runtime with the  `--uncompressed-position` switch, rather than a compile-time choice.
* Removed a dependency on <code>stdint.h</code>.
* Fixed a bug where impractically large APRS-IS packets would be truncated.  This was unlikely to affect real-world use.

## Version 1.1
<time datetime="2019-01-23T11:18:00-05:00">January 23, 2019</time> -- codename QLF
* Added support for reporting temperatures in degrees Celsius.
* Added a Makefile for POSIX systems.
* Added a man page.
* Fixed a bug where negative temperatures may cause the packet to fail to encode.
* Cleaned up some documentation.

## Version 1.0
<time datetime="2019-01-21T00:55:00-05:00">January 21, 2019</time> -- codename QRV
* Added significant documentation.

## Version 0.3
<time datetime="2019-01-20T23:04:02-05:00">January 20, 2019</time> -- codename QST
* Wrote help.
* Added support for actually sending the packet to an APRS-IS IGate.
* Changed the position and wind data to compressed from uncompressed.  For now, this can only be undone at compile-time.

## Version 0.2
<time datetime="2019-01-18">January 18, 2019</time> -- codename "Strings are hard"
* Added support for snowfall, as clarified in APRS 1.1's errata.
* Added support for the APRS 1.2 parameters: radiation, water level, and voltage.

## Version 0.1
<time datetime="2019-01-14T22:15:00-05:00">January 14, 2019</time> -- codename Q
* Initial private release.
